1. Why did you decide to take this class?
      I am taking this class because I am starting my own grantwriting, project evaluation, and consulting business; I would like to create my own website to save on start-up costs, and also think web development is an incredibly practical baseline skill to have! So, I am excited that the final project of this class is to develop our own basic sites.  
      
2. What are a few things you hope to learn?
    I do not have baseline knowledge of internet coding, but as a millenial, I have been navigating the internet almost my whole life.  So while there is some intuitive understanding, I have a lot to learn! I hope to learn how to create a basic, yet dynamic, website; I would like to be able to create something for myself and also for friends with new/small businesses.  Mostly, this is a "I don't know what I don't know" situation -- as I don't even know what building a website entails (coding? back end design/development?).  
    
3. Tell us a little about your image file you uploaded.
    This is me and my dog, Fluffer! We've had quite the adventure since I took her in off the street 3 years ago -- she even reared 11 babies who were born on my 29th birthday; we raised them together and adopted them all out after 8 weeks.  They are dispersed across state lines -- Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Colorado! We come as a package duo :)
