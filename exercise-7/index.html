        <p>For centuries, buffalo were highly regarded within the Tribes’ community, serving as keystone
        figures in ceremonies, traditions, and spirituality within the Tribes’ cultures. To members, the
        buffalo were also imperative for survival, serving as a significant source of clothing, food, and
        shelter. No part of the buffalo was ever wasted – the hide and bones were used to make
        shelters, clothing, everyday items, and for ceremonies, while the meat was used for
        nourishment [1]. The return of the buffalo to the Tribes’ lands after their extermination from those
        lands in the late 1800s offers members the opportunity to once again utilize these invaluable
        animals to support healthy minds, bodies, and spirits.</p>

        <p>Traditionally and even today, buffalo are an important
        source of food and nutrition among community
        members [2]. Many of the Tribal Members understand
        the health benefits of consuming buffalo, as the meat is
        leaner and higher in protein compared to other meat
        sources such as beef. The arrival of buffalo back to the
        Tribes’ lands have many members wondering how to
        re-incorporate buffalo meat into the diets of the Tribal
        Community. Numerous feasibility studies, taste tests,
        and processing surveys have been conducted to
        answer this question. From these results, we can better
        identify how buffalo meat is currently being used, as
        well as determine if processing buffalo meat on the
        Tribes’ lands is an attainable goal for the future.</p>

        <p>After gauging community attitudes towards buffalo using surveys and questionnaires since 2015,
        we know that the buffalo are still regarded as sacred among Tribal members, and that their meat
        is considered a healthy food that should be made easily available to the Tribe. Many people enjoy
        the taste, even if it means adding a little sauce or seasoning, or preparing it differently from beef
        to make it "just right".</p>

        <p>Historically, buffalo have served as an important
        structure within the Tribes' communities. Not
        only did the buffalo provide food, clothing, and
        shelter, but they were also culturally valuable
        as teachers who offered lessons on humility
        and fortitude, while inspiring spirituality [1].
        More than a century after their extermination,
        the buffalo were momentously returned to
        Fort Peck in the early 2000s and 2010s, and
        with them, a chance to finally reconnect with
        and reincorporate the buffalo back into the lives
        of Tribal Members [2].</p>

      <p>An essential step in the right direction has been the regulated hunting of buffalo. Introduced
        in 2003 as a systemic way to contribute to the financial sustainability of the Tribes’ buffalo
        program, the fee-hunting system is an important source of revenue that simultaneously
        ensures the annual availability of buffalo for meat donations [3]. Participation in the Tribal
        Member Buffalo Hunts Lottery guarantees that each tribally enrolled member of the Tribes
        who applies has an equal chance of being selected for the year’s annual hunt. Since 2013,
        these hunts have been formally recorded to include the names of hunt applicants, winners,
        and alternates. From this data, we can better understand the reach of the lottery, and we can
        show how this portion of the buffalo program has grown and developed over time.</p>
