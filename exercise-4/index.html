          <h1>Lyrics</h1>
          <p>[Verse 1]</p>
            Love you in the worst way
            <br>You knock me down like a heavyweight, oh
            <br>We fell in love, got a K-O, oh no
            <br>Too damn young, so we broke up, no-go
            <br>So much for a wedding date, ha.

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            I know nobody gets outta love alive
            <br>We either breakup when we're young
            <br>Or we say goodbye when we die
            <br>For a moment at least
            <br>I know you were mine and it was beautiful
            <br>But winter comes and roses don't survive
            <br>It's getting late, and I should go

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            But I wanna hold you
            <br>Like it's June in the West End
            <br>Back when you were my best friend
            <br>Before love came to kill us
            <br>We're not supposed to
            <br>But I can't learn my lesson
            <br>I miss when you were my best friend
            <br>Before love came to kill us
            <br>So under the mask of the moon
            <br>Could we dance in the past?
            <br>Before love
            <br>Before love came to kill us

            <p>[Verse 2]</p>
            Life's good and I'm getting paid, mmm
            <br>But I think about you everyday, oh no, still
            <br>When I miss you, I medicate (Pour up, drink, drink)
            <br>Tears come out like a renegade, ah

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            'Cause nobody gets outta love alive
            <br>We either breakup when we're young
            <br>Or we say goodbye when we die
            <br>For a moment at least
            <br>I know you were mine and it was beautiful
            <br>But winter comes and roses don't survive
            <br>It's getting late, and I should go

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            But I wanna hold you
            <br>Like it's June in the West End
            <br>Back when you were my best friend
            <br>Before love came to kill us
            <br>We're not supposed to
            <br>But I can't learn my lesson (No, I can't)
            <br>I miss when you were my best friend (Yes, I do)
            <br>Before love came to kill us
            <br>So under the mask of the moon
            <br>Could we dance in the past?
            <br>Before love
            <br>Before love

            <p>[Outro]</p>
            Under the mask of the moon
            <br>Could we dance in the past?
            <br>Before love, mmm
            <br>Before love
            <br>Before love came to kill us
