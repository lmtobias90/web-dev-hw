          <h1>Lyrics</h1>
          <p>[Verse 1]</p>
            <br>Love you in the worst way
            <br>You knock me down like a heavyweight, oh
            <br>We fell in love, got a K-O, oh no
            <br>Too damn young, so we broke up, no-go
            <br>So much for a wedding date, ha.

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            I know nobody gets outta love alive
            We either breakup when we're young
            Or we say goodbye when we die
            For a moment at least
            I know you were mine and it was beautiful
            But winter comes and roses don't survive
            It's getting late, and I should go

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            But I wanna hold you
            Like it's June in the West End
            Back when you were my best friend
            Before love came to kill us
            We're not supposed to
            But I can't learn my lesson
            I miss when you were my best friend
            Before love came to kill us
            So under the mask of the moon
            Could we dance in the past?
            Before love
            Before love came to kill us

            <p>[Verse 2]</p>
            Life's good and I'm getting paid, mmm
            But I think about you everyday, oh no, still
            When I miss you, I medicate (Pour up, drink, drink)
            Tears come out like a renegade, ah

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            'Cause nobody gets outta love alive
            We either breakup when we're young
            Or we say goodbye when we die
            For a moment at least
            I know you were mine and it was beautiful
            But winter comes and roses don't survive
            It's getting late, and I should go

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            But I wanna hold you
            Like it's June in the West End
            Back when you were my best friend
            Before love came to kill us
            We're not supposed to
            But I can't learn my lesson (No, I can't)
            I miss when you were my best friend (Yes, I do)
            Before love came to kill us
            So under the mask of the moon
            Could we dance in the past?
            Before love
            Before love

            <p>[Outro]</p>
            Under the mask of the moon
            Could we dance in the past?
            Before love, mmm
            Before love
            Before love came to kill us
