<!-- @Justine:  How do we know these above words to code for different page blocks? (For example -- how do we know to use .container,
  plus other design words that will lead to different aesthetic design options? further, is 600px standard width always?
  how did you come up with that?). All I did was copy your code from the walkthrough
  video, but I wouldn't know how to replicate this creatively. I.e. if I wanted to change padding or width or color or page block
  shape to my own liking... -->
