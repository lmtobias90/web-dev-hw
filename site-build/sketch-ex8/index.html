        <p> I will be doing a more advanced build of the Sourdough Recipe site I created in <a href="./web-dev-hw/exercise-3/index.html">Exercise 3</a>, using the tools we have learned in class since that exercise.
        <p> It will be a basic landing page with a fixed top site nav bar and a collapsible bar that can navigate up and down the page elements.
          It will also include a blurb about "Mama Kate" and then below it, equally spaced images that lead to new sub-pages of the site, which can also be found
          at the top bar's nav. page.
