        <p><b>The ukulele</b>, popularized in Hawaii, is actually of Portuguese descent. Although it has only four nylon strings,
          versus the guitar's 6, songs can be played at all levels of complexity.  Today, we will learn a very simple 3-chord song that,
          by learning it, will give you a way to touch and impress every friend or family member on their birthday! Also, you can apply
           the learning of these three chords on the ukulele to <i>thousands</i> of other songs!
        </p>

        <p>To play "Happy Birthday" on the ukulele, you only need to learn three chords.  For the diagrams below, the dots represent
        your finger placement for each chord.  The left-most line of this diagram represents the "G" string on the ukulele, which is the string closest
        to your face while <a href="hold-a-ukulele">holding the ukulele</a> as a right-handed player.  For left-handed players, the left-most line would represent the string furthest from
        your face while holding the ukulele.</p>
