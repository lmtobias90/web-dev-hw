      <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>

        <p><u>Special Note:</u> Sourdough takes a long time and multiple different steps before you actually end up with a loaf of bread.
          Unless your full-time job is as a baker, you'll need to play with the rhythm of each step to figure out how it fits into your schedule.
          Each step has the approximate time allotted in parenthesis {ex. (2 hours)} to give you a sense of about how long you should be home and awake to complete each step.
          You can refrigerate your dough in between steps for up to 24-48 hours, until you have enough time to complete the next step in full.
          An example of a full start-to-finish rhythm will be provided after the directions, but ultimately it's up to the baker!</p>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="./refreshing-starter.html" target="_blank"><i>Refresh Your Sourdough Starter</i></a> (4-12 hours)
  <br>
          <li><i>Mix Your Dough</i> (1 hour)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Mix <font color=orange>250g All-Purpose flour + 250g Bread Flour + 400g warm water</font> and knead until fully incorporated.
                Place a damp kitchen cloth over the bowl and let sit (or "autolyse") for at least 45 minutes.</li>
              <li>Mix in <font color=orange>75g activated sourdough starter + 10g salt</font> until the dough is smooth and springy.</li>
              <li>Re-feed your remaining sourdough starter (Step 1) and leave on counter to rise if baking in the next 24 hours.  Otherwise, store in the fridge.
                Follow Step 1 to feed starter weekly or when baking your next loaf, whichever comes first.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Every 30 minutes for 2 hours, stretch & fold the dough to develop the strength of the gluten.</li>
              <li>Cover with a damp cloth in between stretch & folds.</li>
            </ul>
  <br>
          <li><i>First Dough Rise</i></li>
            <ul>
              <li> After final stretch & fold, cover bowl with a damp cloth (or a cover if storing in fridge).<br>
                Let sit no more than 4-6 hours, or 8-24 hours/overnight in the fridge</li>
            </ul>
  <br>
          <li><i>Final Shaping</i> (30 minutes)
            <ol>
              <li>Transfer dough onto a clean, floured surface.</li>
              <li>Shape dough to fit baking container, gently stretching and folding under itself
                to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMspoBQRrEs" target="_blank">create tension</a> on the surface of the loaf.</li>
              <li>Let shaped dough sit on counter for 10-20 minutes</li>
              <li>Using <font color=orange>dough scraper</font>, transfer to a heavily floured <font color=orange>banneton bowl</font> or other final proofing bowl (lined with parchment paper or flour).</li>
              <li>Let proof at room temperature for 1-3 hours or in the fridge for up to 24 hours.
                <br><font color=orange>*Dough will proof much slower in the fridge, so don't proof in the fridge unless it has ample extra time to rise!</font></li>
              <li>Preheat oven to 450&#8457 one hour before you'll be baking your bread.</li>
            </ol>
  <br>
          <li><i>Bake your loaf!</i> (Finally!) (2 hours)</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat your oven to 450&#8457, with the <font color=orange>dutch oven</font> inside.</li>
              <li>Drop your dough from the banneton (or proofing) bowl onto two crossed strips of <font color=orange>parchment paper</font> on the counter.
              <li><a href="https://breadtopia.com/how-to-score-dough/" target="_blank">Score your dough</a></li>
              <li>Using the strips of parchment, gently transfer your dough into your dutch oven or other baking vessel.</li>
              <li>Bake at 450&#8457 for 30 minutes with the top on.</li>
              <li>Remove the lid, turn down to 400&#8457, bake for 20 more minutes or until sufficiently browned</li>
              <li>Let the loaf cool completely before cutting into the loaf!
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <p><u>Other Notes:</u>
          <ul>
            <li>Always work dough with slightly wet hands - it gets extremely sticky!</li>
            <li>You can double the recipe for more loaves; and you can half the refreshed starter measurements to control how much sourdough discard you end up with, if you're not baking consistently.</li>
          </ul>
