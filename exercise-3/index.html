    <h3>DIRECTIONS

      <p><u>Special Note:</u>Sourdough takes a long time and multiple different steps before you actually end up with a loaf of bread.
        Unless your full-time job is as a baker, you'll need to play with the rhythm of each step to figure out how it fits into your schedule.
        Each step has the approximate time allotted in parenthesis {ex. (2 hours)} to give you a sense of about how long you should be home and awake to complete each step.
        You can refrigerate your dough in between steps for up to 24-48 hours, until you have enough time to complete the next step in full.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Refresh Your Starter</i>
          <ul>
            <li>Take starter out of fridge and let come down to room temp.
              (Let sit 2-3 hours or overnight).</li>
            <li>
          </ul>
        <li><i>Mix Your Dough</i> (1 hour)</li>
