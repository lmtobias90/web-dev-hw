    <h3>DIRECTIONS

      <p><u>Special Note:</u> Sourdough takes a long time and multiple different steps before you actually end up with a loaf of bread.
        Unless your full-time job is as a baker, you'll need to play with the rhythm of each step to figure out how it fits into your schedule.
        Each step has the approximate time allotted in parenthesis {ex. (2 hours)} to give you a sense of about how long you should be home and awake to complete each step.
        You can refrigerate your dough in between steps for up to 24-48 hours, until you have enough time to complete the next step in full.
        An example of a full start-to-finish rhythm will be provided after the directions, but ultimately it's up to the baker!</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Refresh Your Sourdough Starter</i> (4-12 hours)
          <ol>
            <li>Take starter out of fridge and let come down to room temp.
              (Let sit 2-3 hours or overnight).</li>
            <li>Weigh out 50g of starter using your <font color=orange>kitchen scale</font> into your <font color=orange>clean, wide-mouth jar</font>. Put the rest in your <font color=orange>"discard" jar</font>.</li>
            <li>Feed starter with <font color=orange>90g lukewarm water</font> (NOT HOT! Too hot will kill your starter!) and <font color=orange>100g bread flour</font>. Mix with a chopstick or butter knife until combined.
            <li>Put 1 <font color=orange>rubber band</font> around where the starter comes up to on your jar, so that you can track how far it rises.</li>
            <li>Put a napkin, coffee filter, cheesecloth, or clean cloth around the top of jar. Secure with <font color=orange>other rubber band</font></li>
            <li>Leave in a warm location until it doubles or triples in size (usually about 4-12 hours depending on how warm the environment is and how active your starter gets after being fed)</li>
            <li>If you don't time it right, and your starter passes its peak and deflates before you get the chance to use it, don't worry! You'll get used to it.  Just re-feed your starter (go back to Step 2) and let it rise again.</li>
          </ol>
            <p><u>Special Notes on Refreshing Your Starter:</u>
              <ul>
                <li>Your starter is ready to bake with when it's doubled or tripled in size and passes the "float test".  Take a pinch of the grown starter and place in a cup of water.  If it floats, it's ready to go! If it doesn't, either let it rise longer, or if it is still liquidy, you might need to feed / refresh the starter again.</li>
                <li>If you notice starter residue farther up your glass jar than it currently is, your starter might have reached its peak growth and then started to sag down.  If it's been a long time since it peaked, you might need to feed/refresh again to get it active enough to bake with.</li>
              </ul></p>
<br>
        <li><i>Mix Your Dough</i> (1 hour)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Mix <font color=orange>250g All-Purpose flour + 250g Bread Flour + 400g warm water</font> and knead until fully incorporated.
              Place a damp kitchen cloth over the bowl and let sit (or "autolyse") for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in <font color=orange>75g activated sourdough starter + 10g salt</font> until the dough is smooth and springy.</li>
            <li>Re-feed your remaining sourdough starter (Step 1) and leave on counter to rise if baking in the next 24 hours.  Otherwise, store in the fridge.
              Follow Step 1 to feed starter weekly or when baking your next loaf, whichever comes first.</li>
          </ul>

        <li><i>Stretch & Fold Dough</i> (2 hours)  |
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc" target="_blank">Demonstration: Stretch & Fold Technique</a></li>

          <ul>
            <li>Every 30 minutes for 2 hours, stretch & fold the dough to develop the strength of the gluten.</li>
            <li>Cover with a damp cloth in between stretch & folds.</li>
          </ul>
<br>
        <li><i>First Dough Rise</i></li>
          <ul>
            <li> After final stretch & fold, cover bowl with a damp cloth (or a cover if storing in fridge).<br>
              Let sit no more than 4-6 hours, or 8-24 hours/overnight in the fridge</li>
          </ul>
<br>
        <li><i>Final Shaping</i> (30 minutes)
          <ol>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a clean, floured surface.</li>
            <li>Shape dough to fit baking container, gently stretching and folding under itself
              to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMspoBQRrEs" target="_blank">create tension</a> on the surface of the loaf.</li>
            <li>Let shaped dough sit on counter for 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Using <font color=orange>dough scraper</font>, transfer to a heavily floured <font color=orange>banneton bowl</font> or other final proofing bowl (lined with parchment paper or flour).</li>
            <li>Let proof at room temperature for 1-3 hours or in the fridge for up to 24 hours.
              <br><font color=orange>*Dough will proof much slower in the fridge, so don't proof in the fridge unless it has ample extra time to rise!</font></li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450&#8457 one hour before you'll be baking your bread.</li>
          </ol>
<br>
        <li><i>Bake your loaf!</i> (Finally!) (2 hours)</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450&#8457, with the <font color=orange>dutch oven</font> inside.</li>
            <li>Drop your dough from the banneton (or proofing) bowl onto two crossed strips of <font color=orange>parchment paper</font> on the counter.
            <li><a href="https://breadtopia.com/how-to-score-dough/" target="_blank">Score your dough</a></li>
            <li>Using the strips of parchment, gently transfer your dough into your dutch oven or other baking vessel.</li>
            <li>Bake at 450&#8457 for 30 minutes with the top on.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, turn down to 400&#8457, bake for 20 more minutes or until sufficiently browned</li>
            <li>Let the loaf cool completely before cutting into the loaf!
          </ol>
      </ol>
      <p><u>Other Notes:</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Always work dough with slightly wet hands - it gets extremely sticky!</li>
          <li>You can double the recipe for more loaves; and you can half the refreshed starter measurements to control how much sourdough discard you end up with, if you're not baking consistently.</li>

        </ul>

      <h3><u>EXAMPLE BAKING RHYTHM:</u>
        <ol>
          <li><i>Refresh Your Sourdough Starter</i> the day or two before you want bread, in the morning.</li>
          <li>Once your starter is activated, <i>Mix your dough</i> in the afternoon, when you'll be awake and home for 3 hours, able to tend to the dough every 30 minutes.</li>
          <li><i>Stretch and fold</i> your dough.</li>
          <li>Cover and allow dough to settle into its <i>First Dough Rise</i>. Refrigerate if it's late, pickup the next day.</li>
          <li>Next morning, take out of the fridge and do the <i>Final Shaping</i>. You can let it rise on the counter to prepare to bake before dinner, or even put it back in the fridge after shaping, to have fresh bread the following morning.</li>
          <li>Preheat your oven and dutch oven for at least 45 minutes, and <i>Bake Your Loaf!</i>
        </ol>
