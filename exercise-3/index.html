    <h3>DIRECTIONS

      <p><u>Special Note:</u> Sourdough takes a long time and multiple different steps before you actually end up with a loaf of bread.
        Unless your full-time job is as a baker, you'll need to play with the rhythm of each step to figure out how it fits into your schedule.
        Each step has the approximate time allotted in parenthesis {ex. (2 hours)} to give you a sense of about how long you should be home and awake to complete each step.
        You can refrigerate your dough in between steps for up to 24-48 hours, until you have enough time to complete the next step in full.
        An example of a full start-to-finish rhythm will be provided after the directions, but ultimately it's up to the baker!</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Refresh Your Sourdough Starter</i> (4-12 hours)
          <ol>
            <li>Take starter out of fridge and let come down to room temp.
              (Let sit 2-3 hours or overnight).</li>
            <li>Weigh out 50g of starter (double for 2 loaves) in your clean, wide-mouth jar. Put the rest in your "discard" jar.</li>
            <li>Feed starter with 90g lukewarm water (NOT HOT! Too hot will kill your starter!) and 100g bread flour. Mix with a chopstick or butter knife until combined.
            <li>Put rubber band around where the starter comes up to, so that you can see how far it rises.</li>
            <li>Put a napkin, coffee filter, cheesecloth, or clean cloth around the top of jar, secure with other rubber band</li>
            <li>Leave in a warm location until it doubles or triples in size (usually about 4-12 hours depending on how warm the environment is and how active your starter gets after being fed)</li>
          </ol>
            <p><u>Special Notes on Refreshing Your Starter:</u>
              <ul>
                <li>Your starter is ready to bake with when it's doubled or tripled in size and passes the "float test".  Take a pinch of the grown starter and place in a cup of water.  If it floats, it's ready to go! If it doesn't, either let it rise longer, or if it is still liquidy, you might need to feed / refresh the starter again.</li>
                <li>If you notice starter residue farther up your glass jar than it currently is, your starter might have reached its peak growth and then started to sag down.  If it's been a long time since it peaked, you might need to feed/refresh again to get it active enough to bake with.</li>
              </ul></p>
<br>
        <li><i>Mix Your Dough</i> (1 hour)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Mix 500g flour + 400g warm water and knead until fully incorporated.
              Place a damp kitchen cloth over the bowl and let sit (or "autolyse") for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in activated sourdough starter + salt until the dough is smooth and springy.</li>
            <li>Re-feed your starter (Step 1) and leave to activate if baking in the next 24 hours.  Otherwise, store in the fridge.
              Follow Step 1 to feed starter weekly or when baking your next loaf, whichever comes first.
          </ul>

        <li><i>Stretch & Fold Dough</i> (2 hours)  |
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc" target="_blank">Demonstration: Stretch & Fold Technique</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Every 30 minutes for 2 hours, stretch & fold the dough to develop the strength of the gluten.</li>
          </ul>
<br>
        <li><i>First Dough Rise</i></li>
          <ul>
            <li> Cover bowl with a damp cloth (or a cover if storing in fridge).<br>
              Let sit no more than 4-6 hours, or 8-24 hours/overnight in the fridge</li>
          </ul>
<br>
        <li><i>Final Shaping</i> |
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMspoBQRrEs" target="_blank">Demonstration: Final Shaping/Creating Tension</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a clean, floured surface.</li>
            <li>Shape dough to fit baking container, gently stretching and folding under itself
              to create tension on the surface of the loaf.</li>
            <li>Let shaped dough sit on counter for 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Using dough scraper, transfer to a heavily floured banneton bowl or other final proofing bowl (lined with parchment paper or flour).</li>
            <li>Let proof at room temperature for 1-3 hours or in the fridge for up to 24 hours.
              <br>Dough will proof much slower in the fridge, so don't proof in the fridge unless it has ample extra time to rise.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit one hour before you'll be baking your bread.</li>
<br>
        <li><i>Bake your loaf!</i> (Finally!)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450 &#8451, with the dutch oven inside.</li>
            <li>Drop your dough from the banneton (or proofing) bowl onto two crossed strips of parchment paper on the counter.
            <li>Score your dough with a large X across the whole top surface.</li>
            <li>Using the strips of parchment, gently transfer your dough into your dutch oven or other baking vessel.</li>
            <li>Bake at 450 for 30 minutes with the top on.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, bake for 20 more minutes or until sufficiently browned</li>
            <li>Let the loaf cool completely before cutting into the loaf!
          </ul>
      </ol>

      <p><u>Other Notes:</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Always work dough with slightly wet hands - it gets extremely sticky!</li>
        </ul>
