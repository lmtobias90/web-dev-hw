    <h3>DIRECTIONS

      <p><u>Special Note:</u> Sourdough takes a long time and multiple different steps before you actually end up with a loaf of bread.
        Unless your full-time job is as a baker, you'll need to play with the rhythm of each step to figure out how it fits into your schedule.
        Each step has the approximate time allotted in parenthesis {ex. (2 hours)} to give you a sense of about how long you should be home and awake to complete each step.
        You can refrigerate your dough in between steps for up to 24-48 hours, until you have enough time to complete the next step in full.
        An example of a full start-to-finish rhythm will be provided after the directions, but ultimately it's up to the baker!</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Refresh Your Sourdough Starter</i> (4-12 hours)
          <ol>
            <li>Take starter out of fridge and let come down to room temp.
              (Let sit 2-3 hours or overnight).</li>
            <li>Weigh out 50g of starter (double for 2 loaves) in your clean, wide-mouth jar. Put the rest in your "discard" jar.</li>
            <li>Feed starter with 90g lukewarm water (NOT HOT! Too hot will kill your starter!) and 100g bread flour. Mix with a chopstick or butter knife until combined.
            <li>Put rubber band around where the starter comes up to, so that you can see how far it rises.</li>
            <li>Put a napkin, coffee filter, cheesecloth, or clean cloth around the top of jar, secure with other rubber band</li>
            <li>Leave in a warm location until it doubles or triples in size (usually about 4-12 hours depending on how warm the environment is and how active your starter gets after being fed)<li></ol>
            <p><u>Special Notes on Refreshing Your Starter:</u>
              <ul>
                <li>Your starter is ready to bake with when it's doubled or tripled in size and passes the "float test".  Take a pinch of the grown starter and place in a cup of water.  If it floats, it's ready to go! If it doesn't, either let it rise longer, or if it is still liquidy, you might need to feed / refresh the starter again.</li>
                <li>If you notice starter residue farther up your glass jar than it currently is, your starter might have reached its peak growth and then started to sag down.  If it's been a long time since it peaked, you might need to feed/refresh again to get it active enough to bake with.</li>
              </ul>
<br>
<br>
        <li><i>Mix Your Dough</i> (1 hour)</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Mix 500g flour + 400g watm water and knead until fully incorporated.
              Place a damp kitchen cloth over the bowl and let sit (or "autolyse") for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in activated sourdough starter + salt until the dough is smooth and springy.</li>
            <li>Re-feed your starter (Step 1) and leave to activate if baking in the next 24 hours.  Otherwise, store in the fridge.
              Follow Step 1 to feed starter weekly or when baking your next loaf, whichever comes first.
          </ol>
<br>
<br>
        <li><i>Stretch & Pull Dough</i> (2 hours)</li>
        <li><i>First Dough Rise</i> (Let sit no more than 4-6 hours, or 8-24 hours/overnight in the fridge)</li>
        <li><i>Final Shaping</i> (Let sit no more than 2-3 hours, or 8-24 hours/overnight in the fridge)</li>
